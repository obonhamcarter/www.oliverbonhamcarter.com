Today we are talking about Machine Learning, or the notion that data can be used to _teach_ a computer to recognize types of patterns. Incredible as it may seem computers, like you, can also learn to do amazing things!

Let's talk about how machine learning works (in a very general sense)! Let's first put ourselves in the place of the learner. 

## Patterns Observed by Humans: Film Posters

Imagine that the below posters are for films that you might go to see. The films are about the action-packed duo, _Smiles and Smiley_ and their adventures.

What do you note about the below themes?

Smiles and Smiley in Space!

</center>

</center>

 If you have studied these posters, then you have certainly noticed that there is a recognizable (and common) _theme_ across all the posters of the set. 
 
What is the common _theme_?!

&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
</center>

To shed some light on this feature, we study a new poster that does not have the common theme. Below, we see a poster of our hero Smiles and Smiley singing along side Taylor Swift.

* What common element of the above posters did you not see?
* What is the common _theme_?!

<center>
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
</center>

One of the common features is that Smiles and Smiley were always featured in front of some beautiful and outdoors scene. In the last poster, Smiles and Smiley were featured singing with Taylor Swift.

## Patterns Observed by Machines

### Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of algorithms that _teach_ a computer how to recognize objects.


* __Supervised learning__: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">WikiPedia</a> to learn more!

* __Unsupervised learning__: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).

* __Reinforcement learning__: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.
