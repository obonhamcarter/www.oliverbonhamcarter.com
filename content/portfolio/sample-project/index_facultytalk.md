### Abstract
It is necessary to update the pedagogy in CS to produce computer scientists who are able to think holistically in the design and development of novel technologies which cater to more humanitarian interests. Alleghenyâ€™s Department of Computer Science, working in tandem with other schools and partners, aims to develop and integrate responsible thinking into the curricula and the technical aspects of its CS courses. This serves to inspire students, and results in the creation of open source projects, activities, programs and associated media in which responsible thinking plays a larger role in the technology. In this talk, I will discuss these issues, in addition to identifying specific approaches and lessons-learned in this effort by our department.
