### Academic Bulletin Description

A study of the design and implementation issues in database management systems. Topics include data models, logical/physical database design, data access/search techniques, normalization theory, mappings from logical to physical structures, storage, and utilization. Additional topics include database reorganization, migration, database integrity, consistency, privacy and secu- rity, distributed database systems, architecture of knowledge-based systems, and intelligent query interfaces. One laboratory per week. Prerequisite: Computer Science 112. Offered in alternate years. Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

### The Lab

In order to acquire the proper skills in technical writing, critical reading, and the presentation and evaluation of technical material, it is essential for students to have hands-on experience in a laboratory. Therefore, it is mandatory for all students to attend the laboratory sessions. If you will not be able to attend a laboratory, then please see the one of the course instructor at least one week in advance in order to explain your situation. Students who miss more than two unexcused laboratories will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. Students who miss more than four unexcused laboratories will automatically fail the course.
