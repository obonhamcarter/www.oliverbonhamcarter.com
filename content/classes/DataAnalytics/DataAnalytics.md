<img src="/images/dataanalytics/volcano.png" alt="drawing" width="100" height="400"/>


### Academic Bulletin Description

An introduction to computational methods of data analysis with an emphasis on understanding and reflecting on the social, cultural, and political issues surrounding data and its interrogation. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students study, design, and implement analytics software and learn how to extract knowledge from, for instance, financial, political, and scientific sources of data. Students also investigate the biases, discriminatory views, and stereotypes that may be present during the collection and analysis of data, reflecting on the ethical implications of using the resulting computational techniques. During a weekly laboratory session, students use state-of-the-art statistical software to complete projects, reporting on their findings through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: FS*102 or FS*200, or permission of the instructor. Distribution Requirements: QR, PD.

<!-- Former Description: An introduction to computational and analytical methods for finding patterns in large data sets. Using statistical procedures that they design and implement in programming environments, students extract knowledge from financial, political, scientific, and other data sources, exploring the issues of power and privilege that emerge from their discoveries. Students also learn to contrast their own perspectives with the ones identified by their analyses, reflecting on the ethical consequences of using the power that originates from computationally derived knowledge. During a weekly laboratory session students employ state-of-the-art statistical software to complete projects, reporting on their findings through both written documents and oral presentations. -->

### The Lab

In order to acquire the proper skills in technical writing, critical reading, and the presentation and evaluation of technical material, it is essential for students to have hands-on experience in a laboratory. Therefore, it is mandatory for all students to attend the laboratory sessions. If you will not be able to attend a laboratory, then please see the one of the course instructor at least one week in advance in order to explain your situation. Students who miss more than two unexcused laboratories will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. Students who miss more than four unexcused laboratories will automatically fail the course.

### Discord

If you are already on the department's Discord server, then you will be given access to the course's Discord channel, called `#dataanalytics`. If not, then you will need to join the department's Discord server before you can be added to the course's channel.
