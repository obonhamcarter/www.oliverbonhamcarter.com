Please visit the GitHub page for this class as [https://cmpsc101fall2025datastructures.github.io/site/](https://cmpsc101fall2025datastructures.github.io/site/).

#### The Academic Bulletin Description

A continuation of CMPSC 100 with an emphasis on implementing, using, and evaluating the computational structures needed to efficiently store and retrieve digital data. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students create data structures and algorithms whose correctness and performance they study through proofs and experimentation. Students continue to refine their ability to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. During a weekly laboratory session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations.Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: CMPSC*100 or permission of the instructor. Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.
