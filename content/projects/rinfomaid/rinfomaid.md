The RinfoMaid is a Rust command-line tool that interacts with the Ollama API to generate text using AI models. The program can either take a prompt from the command line, a prompt file, or ask the user to enter a prompt. It then sends the prompt to the Ollama API and retrieves a generated response, which is saved to a specified output file in markdown format.

NEW and Cool: RinfoMaid now includes Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality! This allows you to build a local knowledge base from your documents (PDF, TXT, MD files) and query them using AI. The system can answer questions using your local documents, saves responses to the 0_out/ directory with automatic file numbering, and falls back to Ollama models when needed.

Why did you work on this project? This project is a learning tool for how to programming nifty AI stuff in Rust. Cool, right?

## Notable Features

This project demonstrates how to interact with an AI model to generate text using the Ollama API, enhanced with powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities. The tool is flexible, allowing users to:

- **Generate text** using various Ollama models with prompts from command line, files, or interactive input
- **Build local knowledge bases** from PDF, TXT, and MD documents
- **Query local documents** using intelligent search with TF-IDF scoring
- **Get source attribution** with relevance scores for transparency
- **Seamlessly integrate** local knowledge with cloud-based AI models

The RAG system makes RinfoMaid particularly powerful for:

- **Document Q&A**: Answer questions about your specific documents
- **Research**: Quickly find relevant information across multiple documents
- **Knowledge Management**: Build searchable repositories of your documents
- **Educational Use**: Learn about AI, document processing, and information retrieval

All results are saved in markdown format, making it easy to view and share the generated responses.
