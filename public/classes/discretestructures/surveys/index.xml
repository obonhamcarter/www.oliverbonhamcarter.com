      <description>Project Goals This assignment invites you to run and observe one Python program called perform-ordered-pair-swap. Instead of using the Poetry tool for managing dependencies and packaging these programs, which the technical skills advise as a best practice, this program is a script, without any dependencies on other Python packages, that you can run through the Python interpreter. As you continue to practice a different way to run a Python program, this project invites you to explore how to (i) find and fix defects in a function and (ii) create and use fixed-size tuples that can contain arbitrary types of data.</description>
