# Data Analytics Notebooks - JupyterLite

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data analytics lessons that run in your browser using JupyterLite.

## üöÄ Getting Started

**IMPORTANT: Before using any data analytics notebooks, run the package installation notebook first:**

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
1. Open **00-install-packages.ipynb**
2. Run all cells to install seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scipy, and plotly
3. Wait for installation to complete (may take 1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Use Data Analytics Notebooks
Once packages are installed, you can use any of the data analytics notebooks.

## üìö Available Notebooks

- **numpy** - Numerical computing
- **matplotlib** - Basic plotting and visualization
- **seaborn** - Statistical data visualization
- **scipy** - Scientific computing and statistics
- **plotly** - Interactive plotting (when available)

## üí° Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to the JupyterLite environment at `/live/` on this website
2. **First time users:** Open and run **00-install-packages.ipynb** to install packages
3. Open any of the data analytics notebook files listed above
4. Run the cells to execute Python code directly in your browser
5. No local installation required - everything runs client-side using Pyodide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Package installation is required once per browser session**
- If you get "ModuleNotFoundError", run the package installation notebook
- Package installation may take 1-2 minutes depending on your internet connection
- Notebooks run entirely in your browser - no server connection needed

## üéì Note for Instructors

These notebooks are designed for educational use and run entirely in the browser. Students don't need to install Python or any packages locally, but they do need to run the package installation notebook once per session.
