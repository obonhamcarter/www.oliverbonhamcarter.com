Welcome to the interactive data analytics learning environment! This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that you can run directly in your browser using JupyterLite.

## Available Notebooks

### ðŸ“Š Data Analytics Course Series

Complete the lessons in order to build your data analysis skills:

1. **`data-analytics-01-loading-data.ipynb`** - Introduction to loading and viewing data with pandas
2. **`data-analytics-02-exploring-data.ipynb`** - Asking questions and finding patterns in data  
3. **`data-analytics-03-basic-plots.ipynb`** - Creating visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn
4. **`data-analytics-04-basic-statistics.ipynb`** - Understanding statistical measures and summaries
5. **`data-analytics-05-correlations.ipynb`** - Discovering relationships and correlations
6. **`data-analytics-06-advanced-analysis.ipynb`** - P-values, t-tests, and linear regression

### ðŸ§ª Test & Example Notebooks

- **`seaborn-test.ipynb`** - Test that seaborn and data science libraries are working
- **`compute-average-with-file.ipynb`** - Example of file operations and calculations
- **`hammingCodes.ipynb`** - Computer science example with error correction codes

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Open JupyterLite by visiting: [https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/live/](https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/live/)
2. Click on any `.ipynb` file to open it
3. Run code cells by pressing `Shift + Enter`
4. Modify the code and experiment with your own data!

## ðŸ“š Available Libraries

These Python libraries are pre-installed and ready to use:

- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy** - Numerical computing
- **matplotlib** - Basic plotting and visualization  
- **seaborn** - Statistical data visualization
- **scipy** - Scientific computing and statistics
- **plotly** - Interactive visualizations

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

- Start with Lesson 1 if you're new to data analysis
- Run the `seaborn-test.ipynb` notebook first to verify everything is working
- Experiment with the code - change values and see what happens!
- Save your work locally since JupyterLite runs in your browser
- Ask questions and explore the data creatively
