      <description>Today we are talking about Machine Learning, or the notion that data can be used to teach a computer to recognize types of patterns. Incredible as it may seem computers, like you, can also learn to do amazing things!
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how machine learning works (in a very general sense)! Let&amp;rsquo;s first put ourselves in the place of the learner.

      <description>Determining the difference between the means of two data sets. How would you determine the difference between the averages following two datasets? We show a scatter plot and a histogram plot for each group (i.e., 1 and 2). Are these plots enough to determine a likeness between the plots?
But first, let&amp;rsquo;s get into a Jupyter client where we can run Python code.
&amp;#x200B; The Data How could you differentiate the two data sets shown below?</description>

      <description>Here we spend some time to look at plots which are not like the traditional plots that we have seen before. Below are different ways to use plots to describe data.
But first, let&amp;rsquo;s get into a Jupyter client where we can run Python code.

      <description>&amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; We will spend a moment to study different ways of visually describing data using plots. Here we will develope some Python programming techniques to create some data to be used for plotting. In specific, we will look at several types of plots and then decide what types of features each plot has and how it could be helpful when describing data.
