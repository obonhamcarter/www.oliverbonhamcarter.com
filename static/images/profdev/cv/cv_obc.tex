\cventry{}{\textbf{Research Overview}}{}{}{}{}

As a data scientist, my research focuses on designing and developing software tools that facilitate analysis of various data ranging from gene expression to text data. As an empirical scientist, I also follow the scientific method to develop research questions, design experiments using the tools I develop, analyze the results of my experiments, and make conclusions. To achieve this, I use statistical methods, machine learning models, and various computational techniques.  My research addresses the challenges within the fields of data science,  bioinformatics, health informatics,  computational biology, and other related fields.
